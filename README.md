# comparison_REL
This reposiory contains codes for three methodes ("Language Models are Knowledge Graphs", OpenNRE, FRED) that extracts entities and link or predict relations between them
## Extra codes
We provided a code that extracts relation between two entities and plot them into a Graph. This code tries to replicate the general idea of the paper "LMs are KG" but in a simple way, relying on Python,SpaCy and networkx for dataframe.
## other codes
I had to go through many concepts like sentiments analysis and using BERT or GPT-2 to understand a bit machine learning.
