# comparison_REL
This reposiory contains codes for extracting and linking entities with or without Language Models (BERT and GPT-2) and even sentiment analysis with those LMS.
We provided a code "REL_Graph" that extracts relation between two entities and plot them into a Graph. This code tries to replicate the general idea of the paper "Language Models are Open Knowledge Graphs" but in a simple way, relying on Python,SpaCy and networkx for dataframe.

## Papers repositories
The repositories of the main papers "Language Models are Open Knowledge Graphs", OpenNRE and the other repos that helps implementing them were forked into my account.
### SpaCy
spaCy is a free open-source library for Natural Language Processing in Python. It features NER, POS tagging, dependency parsing, word vectors and more. I provided this link to help creating an environment: https://ashutoshtripathi.com/2020/04/02/spacy-installation-and-basic-operations-nlp-text-processing-library/
